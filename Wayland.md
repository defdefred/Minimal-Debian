## Kitty
Very good GPU accelerated terminal.
Works well with `vim` .
Capability to display image with `kitty +icat image.jpg` .

## Firefox
Don't forget:
- Configuring GPU acceleration (ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2021/08/enable-hardware-video-acceleration-va-api-for-firefox-in-ubuntu-20-04-18-04-higher/)
- uBlock Origin against Ads.
- H264fy against vp9/AVC1 codec (maybe not useful for you, check your GPU compatibility with vainfo)
